| CCOAP - CoAP implementation in C |
+----------------------------------+

CCOAP is a CoAP implementation written in C for Linux/MacOSX.
It allows quick implementation of client/server applications
with the help of a simple API. 

CCOAP is based on draft-ietf-core-coap-08:

The CCOAP project is composed of:

+--apps/

|     |
|     +--demo_commandline/
|     |   * This sample application is a commandline client 
|     |     and server tool for tests purposes. The client allows 
|     |     the setting of various CoAP options from the commandline
|     |     (such as message and query type, payload, etc.), which 
|     |     can be useful for tests against a server. The server 
|     |     replies to GET messages with a payload filled with the
|     |     current time (otherwise it just replies with an empty 
|     |     payload). The server can also be configured to reply
|     |     with some delay in order to emulate lossy networks.

1. How to compile and/or clean the code
---------------------------------------

Retrieve the code and create a new directory for the project,
at the same level than the ccoap/ directory. It will be used
to build the code:
$ mkdir ccoap_build
$ cd ccoap_build/

Build the code (you can also use Release instead of Debug):
$ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../ccoap
$ make

The "Release" flag will remove most of the debug messages, 
but will keep error messages. 

Application binaries are located in the 'bin' directory. The 
CCOAP libraries are in the 'lib' directory.

You can install the binaries and libraries with "make install".
You can cleanup the code with "make clean".

Note that '.cproject' and '.project' files for Eclipse are 
also available in the ccoap/ directory. 


2. How to run a sample application
----------------------------------

First, you need to put the CoAP port number (5683) in your
/etc/services file. On Linux, add the following line:
coap   udp/5683

On MacOSX (10.8) this is slightly different, you need to add:
coap   5683/udp

Some sample applications are located in the ccoap_build/bin/ 
directory:
- coap_client_time / coap_server_time is a simple CoAP
  client / server application to retrieve data (here, 
  the current time) by a client from a server.
- coap_client_commandline / coap_server_commandline is 
  a configurable CoAP client and server from the
  commandline. 

All of these sample applications accept the '-h' option to 
display some help about their command line options. 

They also accept the '-f' option to provide a configuration
file. Sample configuration files are located in the
doc/sample_config directory. 

For example, for the time application, on the server side,
you should use:
$ ./coap_server_time -f path/to/coap_server_config 

On the client side:
$ ./coap_client_time -t <0/1> \
                     -s <1-1000> \
                     -f path/to/coap_client_config

The '-t' option can be used with 0 for sending CON message, 
or 1 for sending NON message. The '-s' option can be used with 
a number between 1 and 1000 to send the corresponding number
or requests (i.e. '-s 15' will send 15 requests).

You should get a detailed description of the reply including
the current time sent by the server.

Note: On MacOSX, if you use localhost as the server address, 
you need to explicitely specify '127.0.0.1' instead of
'localhost' in the configuration file of the client. 


3. Build you own client and server
----------------------------------

There are several examples of clients and servers using the
CCOAP library in the apps/examples/ directory. You can use
them as a base to start writing your own applications. The 
CCOAP API is documented using Doxygen, you can find the 
documentation in doc/doxygen/html/.

Let's take the apps/examples/demo_time/ application as an 
example. 


* The main server code (demo_time/server_main.c):

In the main() function, the default configuration items are
loaded with coap_default_config()

The application type (here, COAP_ENUM_REQ_TIME) and handler
(coap_req_handler_demo) for this type are registered with 
coap_serv_handler_regist(). Basically, handlers are callback
functions called to process a request for a certain type of
application.

Your server can register multiple application types and 
handlers. At the moment, new application types must be 
manually  added in the coap_req_type structure of the 
lib/ccoapapps/server_handlers/handlers.h file. 

The coap_req_handler_demo() handler is implemented in the 
shared/server_handler.c file that we describe later.

The server can then process the extra command line arguments
(such as the one to provide the configuration file). The 
coap_server_config() function can be called to process the 
configuration file given as argument. 

The coap_server_init() must then be called to initialize
the server functions. After that, a call to the 
coap_server_run() function starts the the main server loop.
Before the server exits, coap_server_cleanup() must be
called. 


* The server handler (demo_time/server_handler.c and 
  shared/server_handler.h):

called coap_req_handler_demo() is a simple handler for the 
time application. It handles the GET messages received from 
the client and fill the reply with the current time.

For a slightly different handler example , you can have a look
at the demo_commandline/server_handler.c file.


* The main client code (demo_time/client_main.c):

In the main() function, the default configuration items are
loaded with coap_default_config()

The application type (here, COAP_ENUM_USER_TIME) and task 
(coap_tasks_demo) for this type are registered with 
coap_client_task_regist(). Basically, tasks are callback
functions called when application data that matches the 
request is is received by the client. 

At the moment, new application types must be manually
added in the coap_user_type structure of the 
lib/ccoapapps/client_tasks/tasks.h file. 

The coap_tasks_demo() task function is implemented in the 
shared/tasks_demo.c file that we describe later.

The client can then process the extra command line arguments
(such as the one to provide the configuration file). The 
coap_client_config() function can be called to process the 
configuration file given as argument. 

The coap_client_init() must then be called to initialize
the client functions. After that, a call to the 
coap_client_run() function starts the the main client loop.
It takes as an argument a callback function (here get_task(), 
defined at the top of the file) and the data for this callback
function. The data is user-defined with the definition of the
task_data structure at the beginning of the file. Before
the client exits, coap_client_cleanup() must be called. 

The get_task() function defined at the top of the file is
a callback function called every time the client sends an 
application message to the server. It must be defined by the
application developper and contain the code that fills the
CoAP message options and payload. In the application
example, we fill the CoAP header with a URI equal to 'time'
in order to ask for the '/time' data to the server. 


* The client tasks (shared/tasks_demo.{c;h}):

This sample tasks callback is called coap_tasks_demo() and is
also used by the demo_commandline/ application. Upon reception
of application messages from the server, it simply calls the 
coap_dump_msg() to display the received message, and dump the 
payload with coap_dump_payload().


* Some more useful functions

You can find all of the API in the include/ccoaplib.h file that
you should include in your application files. 

Some useful macros for debug can be used in your application
developments. You can use them similarly as the 'printf'
function:
- DBG(): prints your debug message preprended with the
  function name. The macro is disabled when the code is
  compiled in 'Release' mode.
- CDBG(): similar to DBG() except that the debug message is 
  not prepended with the function name
- ERROR(): similar to DBG() except that the macro is never
  disabled, even in 'Release' mode.
